There are so many great books available about cities, how they work, and how to plan them, so why write another?
This book aims to
bridge a gap between books aimed at communicating the ideas and models of neoclassical urban economics, which tend
to rely heavily on the assumptions of neoclassical economics at the expense of more nuanced consideration of equity
concerns and political economy aspects of cities and the metropolitan regions they inhabit, and to be relatively
uninformed by the emergence of massive amounts of emerging data about cities, and to gloss over the details of
urban form, design, and structure in favor of more stylized, mathematically tractable theoretical representations.  The
aims of this book are to balance ideas from urban economics with consideration of equity and the structuring of
markets for real estate, labor, infrastructure and public services by cities, counties, metropolitan planning
organizations, state and federal agencies.  We also seek to broaden the discussion by taking a
more modern approach to engaging theory with data.  The proliferation of publicly available data and the rapid
advancement of analytical and computational methods to analyze data about cities and metropolitan areas has not, in
my assessment, been adequately integrated into an accessible, scholarly introduction to cities and metropolitan
areas.  We think there is much to be gained from a balancing of theory with data, and from beginning with less strong
assumptions than those that have guided much of the development of urban economics, and instead approaching cities with a
combination of prior expectations rooted in theory, curiosity, and an open mind to be influenced by data that
is rapidly emerging about almost every dimension of urban life.
